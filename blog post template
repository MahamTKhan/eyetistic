            <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
            <p>Weak eyesight, also known as visual impairment, is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It refers to a diminished ability to see clearly or have normal vision. In this article, we will explore the causes, symptoms, and remedies for weak eyesight, shedding light on this prevalent condition and providing insights into maintaining healthy vision.</p>

            <h4>CAUSES FOR WEAK EYESIGHT:</h4>
            <p>
              Refractive Errors: The most common cause of weak eyesight is refractive errors, including nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), and astigmatism. These occur when the shape of the eye prevents light from focusing properly on the retina.
              <br />
              Age-Related Changes: As we age, the natural aging process can lead to weak eyesight. Presbyopia is a common age-related condition where the lens of the eye loses flexibility, making it difficult to focus on close objects.
              <br />
              Eye Diseases: Certain eye diseases, such as cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy, can contribute to weak eyesight. These conditions affect the structures of the eye, impairing vision.
              <br />
              Genetics: Hereditary factors play a role in weak eyesight. If your parents or close relatives have visual impairments, you may be more prone to developing similar conditions.

            <h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4>
